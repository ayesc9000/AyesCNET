I'm a senior year high school student, preparing to start college. I work on
small software projects as a hobby, and I have a passion for all things technology
and engineering related.

I'm currently working on my Discord bot Onyix. It's written in C# using dsharpplus.
I might revive some of my older projects in the future, but I can't be bothered
to right now :p
