I'm a college student working professionally in computer repair and IT. I have a
strong passion for basically anything related to technology and like to spend my
free time working on software and hardware projects.

I spend most of my time lurking online on sites like Slashdot, but I occasionally
write a post about something I am working on or my opinions on technology news and
other developments.
