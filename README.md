# About

This is the repository for my website, sometimes referred to as "AyesCNET" internally.
I write about whatever I want on here, and also publish my resume and contact info
as well.

The website uses Jekyll to build, and requires you to have Ruby installed.

Follow the Jekyll setup instructions over on their website to set up Jekyll on your
system, then install bundle and all necessary packages with `gem install bundle` followed by `bundle`.

You can start Jekyll with `bundle exec jekyll serve`, **Or if you are using VS Code** press F5 to run the included launch profile.
