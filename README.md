# About

This is the repository for my website, sometimes referred to as "AyesCNET" internally.
I write about whatever I want on here, and also publish my resume and contact info
as well.

The website uses Jekyll to build, and requires you to have Ruby installed.

Follow the Jekyll setup instructions over on their website to set up Jekyll on your
system, then come back here and run `bundle exec jekyll serve` OR FOR VS CODE USERS
press F5 to automatically run Jekyll.

# Contributing

Maintenance, security, grammatical, and compatibility suggestions are welcome, but
submissions related to new pages or changes in overall design will very likely be
ignored, since this is my own personal website.
