# AyesCNET

This is the repository for my homepage. It contains basic info about myself, my resume, and my contact info.

My website doesn't use any javascript frameworks or whatnot, since it doesn't really need it due to it's simplicity.

## Contributing

Maintenance, security, grammatical, and compatibility suggestions are welcome, but submissions related to new pages or changes in overall design will very likely be ignored, since this is my own personal website.
